# Automative-Extractive-Summerizer
An extractive text summerizer model built implementing Google's page ranking algorithm through cosine approach by the means of word vectors and text processing.
 
Application:-
Propelled by the modern technological innovations, data is to this century what oil was to the previous one. Today, our world is parachuted by the gathering and dissemination of huge amounts of data.
With such a big amount of data circulating in the digital space, there is need to develop machine learning algorithms that can automatically shorten longer texts and deliver accurate summaries that can fluently pass the intended messages.
Furthermore, applying text summarization reduces reading time, accelerates the process of researching for information, and increases the amount of information that can fit in an area.

Libraries Used:-
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Jupyter

Built on :- Jupyter Notebook
